# Slow Build with Claude Code

Free, interactive tools for product managers — built with Claude Code, learned through Claude Code.

## What's inside

**Pre-Read Generator** — Paste a meeting transcript, get a pre-read for your next meeting. It builds memory over time — decisions, action items, and open questions carry forward automatically. Use it before meetings to communicate key items to your team. From here, you can extend it by adding calendar auth, connecting to MCPs, or automating pre-reads to send directly to attendees.

**Feedback Analyzer** — Paste customer feedback, get it categorized and prioritized. Use it to surface bugs, spot feature requests, generate ideas, and draft PRDs. Enhance it by attaching your company goals, product context, and analytics to make the output even sharper.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justirma/slowbuild-with-claude-code.git
cd slowbuild-with-claude-code
claude
```

Then run `/start`.
