The app crashes every time I try to export a PDF. This has been happening for two days now.
Love the new dashboard redesign! It's so much easier to find what I need.
The onboarding flow is confusing — I couldn't figure out how to invite my team members.
Would be great if you added a dark mode option. I use the app late at night and it's really bright.
Search is broken on mobile. It just shows a blank screen when I type anything.
The weekly summary email is my favorite feature. Saves me so much time every Monday.
Can you add Slack integration? We use Slack for everything and it would be nice to get notifications there.
The loading time on the reports page is terrible. I waited 30 seconds for it to load today.
I accidentally deleted a project and there's no way to undo it. Please add a trash/recovery feature.
Your customer support team was incredibly helpful when I had billing questions. Thank you!
