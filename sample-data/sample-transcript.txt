Product Sync Weekly — January 15, 2025

Attendees: Sarah (PM), Mike (Eng Lead), Priya (Design), Tom (QA)

Sarah: Alright, let's get started. Mike, where are we on the search redesign?

Mike: We shipped the backend changes last Thursday. Frontend is about 80% done. Should be ready for QA by end of this week.

Sarah: Great. Priya, how's the design for the new settings page?

Priya: I finished the mockups. I'll share the Figma link after this call. One thing — I need a decision on whether we're doing the tabbed layout or the single-scroll layout. I mocked up both.

Sarah: Let's go with the tabbed layout. It tested better in the user interviews last month.

Tom: Quick flag — I found a regression in the export feature. PDFs are generating with broken formatting since the last deploy. I'd call it a P1.

Mike: I saw that too. I'll have a fix out by tomorrow.

Sarah: Thanks Mike. Tom, can you verify the fix once it's deployed?

Tom: Yep, I'll test it as soon as it's up.

Sarah: Other updates?

Priya: I'm still waiting on the brand guidelines update from marketing. I pinged them last week but haven't heard back. It's blocking the landing page redesign.

Sarah: I'll follow up with marketing today. We need those by Friday at the latest.

Mike: One more thing — we need to decide on the analytics provider. I've been evaluating Mixpanel and Amplitude. Can we make a call on that next meeting? I'll have a comparison doc ready.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's plan to decide on analytics next week. Anything else? Alright, good meeting everyone.
