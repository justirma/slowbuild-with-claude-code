The user has tried one or both tools. Wrap up the session.

1. Acknowledge what they built/produced — reference the files in `my-work/`.

2. Share what's next for each tool they tried:
   - **Feedback Analyzer**: "Run this whenever you get a batch of feedback — support tickets, survey responses, NPS comments. Paste and go."
   - **Pre-Read Generator**: "Process your next meeting transcript with `/preread-generator`. The memory builds over time — open items carry forward, nothing gets dropped."

3. Mention they can always run `/start` to pick the other tool if they haven't tried both.

4. Point them to the GitHub repos if they want to dig deeper or customize:
   - Feedback Analyzer: https://github.com/justirma/pm-feedback-analyzer
   - Pre-Read Generator: https://github.com/justirma/preread-skill

5. Mention: "More tools coming soon. Subscribe to https://slobuild.substack.com to stay up to date."

Keep it brief. No long pep talks.
