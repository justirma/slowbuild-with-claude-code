Welcome the user to Slow Build with Claude Code.

Keep it short and warm. Then:

1. Check if they have an Anthropic API key set up. If not, walk them through getting one at https://console.anthropic.com/. They'll need it for both tools.

2. Ask: "Which tool do you want to try?"
   - **Feedback Analyzer** — categorize and prioritize customer feedback
   - **Pre-Read Generator** — turn meeting transcripts into pre-reads

3. Ask: "How do you want to learn?"
   - **Just use it** — jump straight in
   - **Walk me through it** — I'll explain what's happening along the way

Remember their mode choice for the session.

Then direct them to run `/feedback-analyzer` or `/preread-generator` based on their pick.
